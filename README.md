# System Dynamics Model

An implemention of the model from Duggan's paper: System Dynamics Modeling with R (Lecture Notes in Social Networks), Duggan, Jim.

A system dynamics representation of the health sector using Shiny. Systems 
thinking is a departure from linear thinking, as system dynamics attempts to 
understand nonlinear behaviour of participants over time using stocks, flows, 
feedback loops, table functions and other functions such as time delays.
