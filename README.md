# System Dynamics Model

This is an implementation of a model from a paper: Duggan, Jim. System Dynamics Modeling with R (Lecture Notes in Social Networks) 

System Dynamics representation of the Health Sector using Shiny.

Systems thinking is a departure from linear thinking, as system dynamics attempts to understand nonlinear behaviour of participants over time using stocks, flows, feedback loops, table functions and other functions (eg time delays).
